1. What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It identifies the directory as a git repo.
A .git file is generated to store the metadata about the files in the repo.


2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory contains any saved file within it, not tracking any
versions or change history.
The repository contains all files that are being tracked, every version since
you started tracking them, and all metadata on those files.
The staging area is a halfway house for files. They have been created and may
have had some changes made to them, but those changes have not yet been
committed to the version/change history in the repository.

The staging area has value for:
- Breaking up commits, especially on the initial commit.
- Providing a two-step process gives a break point if you change your mind or
have made a mistake.
- It also provides the opportunity to batch up changes into a single commit.


3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

The staging area gives the opportunity to check what changes have been made
before they are committed. You can the  make sure you only commit the logically
grouped changes to the repo.
