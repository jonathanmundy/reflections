1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For a number of reasons: when collaborating with others, when you want to use multiple machines,
to open up the repo for contributors (open source), and to keep a separate copy of your repo.


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than have Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You want to be in control of the state of your repo on your local machine. If
you were collaborating on a team, using Github, and your local repo automatically
pulled repo updates from Github, you might end up with multiple conflicts and
changes you weren't expecting.


3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

A branch is a label for a history of commits that are separated from master,
useful for new logically separate features, bug fixes or experiments.
A clone is a copy of a repo, including all the history. Useful for copying a repo
from one machine to another (including Github to machine).
A fork is Github's version of a clone. It's a copy of a Github repo, which is
copied into your own Github repo. Useful when you want to leverage someone's
repo work (and ensure they retain credit) and update it with your own work
(without impacting the original repo).
