1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For a number of reasons: when collaborating with others, when you want to use multiple machines,
to open up the repo for contributors (open source), and to keep a separate copy of your repo.


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than have Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You want to be in control of the state of your repo on your local machine. If
you were collaborating on a team, using Github, and your local repo automatically
pulled repo updates from Github, you might end up with multiple conflicts and
changes you weren't expecting.
